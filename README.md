## 📊 About the Dataset – Iris Flower Classification

### 🌸 Context

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most well-known datasets in the fields of **machine learning** and **statistics**.  
Originally introduced by **Sir Ronald A. Fisher** in 1936, it's widely used for tasks like **classification**, **data visualization**, and **pattern recognition**. 🌿

The dataset contains measurements of **150 iris flowers**, evenly distributed across **three species**:

- 🟣 *Iris-setosa*  
- 🔵 *Iris-versicolor*  
- 🔴 *Iris-virginica*

---

### 📦 Content

Each row in the dataset represents an individual flower and contains:

- **4 numerical features**, measured in centimeters  
- **1 target label** indicating the flower species  

There are **no missing values**, making it an ideal dataset for beginners and model benchmarking.

### 🧾 Column Descriptions

- 📏 `sepal_length` – Length of the sepal in cm (outer part that protects petals)  
- 📐 `sepal_width` – Width of the sepal in cm  
- 🌼 `petal_length` – Length of the petal in cm (colorful, inner part of the flower)  
- 🌼 `petal_width` – Width of the petal in cm  
- 🏷️ `species` – The iris flower species (target variable):  
  - *Iris-setosa* 🟣  
  - *Iris-versicolor* 🔵  
  - *Iris-virginica* 🔴
