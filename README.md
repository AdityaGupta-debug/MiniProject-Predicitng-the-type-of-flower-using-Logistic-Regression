📊 About the Dataset – Iris Flower Classification

🌸 Context
The Iris dataset is a classic in the field of machine learning and statistics. It was first introduced by Sir Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 and is commonly used for classification tasks, data visualization, and pattern recognition. 🌿
It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers, divided evenly across three species:

🟣 Iris-setosa

🔵 Iris-versicolor

🔴 Iris-virginica

The dataset is small, clean, and ideal for beginners who want to understand how machine learning models work on a simple classification problem. 🧠📈

📦 Content
Each row in the dataset represents an individual flower and includes four measured features and one target label (the species). There are no missing values, and all features are numerical and measured in centimeters.

🧾 Column Descriptions
📏 sepal_length: The length of the sepal in centimeters. Sepals are the outer parts of the flower that protect the petals when in bud.

📐 sepal_width: The width of the sepal in centimeters. Along with sepal length, this helps define the outer flower structure.

🌼 petal_length: The length of the petal in centimeters. Petals are the colorful parts that vary significantly among species.

🌼 petal_width: The width of the petal in centimeters. One of the most distinguishing features across iris species.

🏷️ species: The type of iris flower – this is the target variable for classification. The possible values are:
  - Iris-setosa 🟣
  - Iris-versicolor 🔵
  - Iris-virginica 🔴
